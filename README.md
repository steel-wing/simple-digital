# Simple Digital
When I got my pebble smartwatch in 2016, I knew I wanted a basic digital watchface. I looked around for a bit, and found none that did quite what I was looking for. So I made one using the RockyJS framework for Javascript programming on the pebble. THe JavaScript implementations on the Pebble are not the most elegant, however, and aren't compatable with the oldest Pebbles, and so this is a final, perfected version of the one I made in 2017, now written in C.

## Details
The watchface simulates a 7-segment display, as shown. The numbers are auto-centered, based on the size of the watch. See my watchface [Total Digital](https://github.com/steel-wing/total-digital) for a more customizable version.
